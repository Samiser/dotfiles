# Samiser's Dotfiles

This is a collection of configuration files used across my systems.
Feel free to browse them and use them as you please :)

## Dependencies

I've listed all of the programs used by these dotfiles in the programs.csv file.
If you install all of these everything should work.
You probably already have most if not all of these installed so dw too much about it.
If you're only looking to use the dotfiles for a particular program obviously you don't need to
install all of these programs, just the ones that file depends on.

## Usage

To actually use the dotfiles by putting them in the correct places, just run the `install.sh` script to install them.
